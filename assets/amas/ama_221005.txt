I'm doing a research in Twitch and observing your community, do you prefer your stream's name censored or nah? I might publish it in academic journals tho

Sure

Will you be watching the final installment in the most recent Halloween trilogy, Halloween Ends? Also will you ever make a trip to NA so I can get your autograph admiralDaki
-
-
Yea ofc, i grew up with slasher, it was some of my favorite stuff, jason, freddy, chucky, michael amongst some, always watch the new stuff, even if its bad.
Luckily the new halloween movies have been decent to good.



belle â€” Today at 3:31 PM
Have you watched Rings of Power yet? If so, thoughts?
-
-
I like it alot, even tho the wokeness was somewhat annoying to begin with, i dont really think of it, and the woke characters are pretty good aswell so you forget about it, atleast i do.
Main gripe is how alot of elves dont look like elves. 
orcs are great, wandering day song 10/10



Brahtius â€” Today at 3:38 PM

Grilled probably.

What is the best indian food that you have eaten? or do you not prefer it cause its on a little spicier side and has lot of calories and fat content?
-
-
i dont know the names of food, something butter chicken? I do like asian/indian food alot, almost more than swedish food because you guys drench it in salt (soy sauce) and high amount of fat.

Galadriel is hot but what about the milf Bronwyn? Any thoughts on her?
-
-
Yea she pretty fine, id mate with her.


Maogor the Cruel â€” Today at 4:11 PM
what do u think about harfoots? do u think nori is cute?
-
-
Found them the worst part of the show ep 1-2 but they have grown on me. The wandering day song helped also.



Ponyboy â€” Today at 4:17 PM
Since liquid is technically old alliance, if they qualify. Does that mean you'll come to Singapore TI?
-
-
No i dont think so



Maogor the Cruel â€” Today at 4:41 PM
this is October, time to horror fest, what horror movie scared u the most, and what scene?
-
-
Well nothing now, but as a kid nothing came close to watching chucky movies as a 9 year old



jaskitty â€” Today at 5:27 PM
How would you react if the person you're currently dating and courting for a while reveals that they're not over their ex? Would you try to "fix" her or move on?
-
-
Id end it. unless shes 10/10 then id give her some time



boxod â€” Today at 6:16 PM

admiralanjing â€” Today at 6:20 PM
did you dress up for halloween when we you little? what is your most fond memory from your childhood?
-
-
No, halloween isnt really big in sweden, i have no memories of any specific dress up, there was mild trick or treating but i think its dead now.



scrabben â€” Yesterday at 8:12 PM
any sponsored game you unironically enjoyed the most (after raid shadowlegends)
-
-
Hearthstone was by far the most enjoyable, did it twice now, more so standard than battlegrounds tho



W â€” Yesterday at 9:01 PM
Do you plan to play a few horror games in october besides friday the 13th?

-
No special game planned, but ill there might be some new horrors around



North APE 2 â€” Yesterday at 9:30 PM
What's your favorite winter sport/activity if any? Ever tried snowboard/skiing?
-
-
yes, i do enjoy it, its one of the future vacation i will for sure be doing, skiing


Bruoh, the Skeleton King â€” Yesterday at 9:59 PM
What is an aspect of old dota you would want to come back? (No backpack, no tp scroll slot, one courier, side shops, perhaps old rosh pits?) With the understanding that these features are good quality of life, still consider an answer.
-
-
While new tp scroll slot is very nice quality of life, it has hurt ratting massively so prob that



Laden â€” Yesterday at 10:42 PM
With all the shitty Twitch changes, is there some that you would like, something like increased bitrate, better vod and clip player
-
-
Well i started using 2 pc setup around 2016, back then it was useful. Now its definitely not worth anymore, so it would be nice if twitch would allow 120fps streams with higher bitrate
so the setup makes more sense and more worth it



Arken â€” Today at 12:10 AM
any chance we get movie nights back? since its October and we used to watch scuffed horror movies
-
-
no, movie night is too complicated to run. Having a place where 100-300 ppl can watch with decent quality is complicated, its hard to replicate twitch.
If anyone has suggestions you cna let me know



Snake Gang Paris â€” Today at 1:40 AM
There are only 2 months left of the year. What's the best thing that happened to you so far this year? Did you achieve your new year's resolution  (if you have any)?
-
-
Getting to meet alot of megacucks and rae at stockholm major :)


LiquidWater â€” Today at 2:38 AM
any plans to go to twitch con in :KKona: land this year? i hear your best friends lacari and rae will be there
-
-
Nope



Le JonD â€” Today at 3:20 AM


a.) As the only ethical smurf I know and the embodiment of the Art of War itself, what do you think of the recent debacle and slew of complaints of valve being "unethical and insensitive"? 
From talent selections to streaming hub locations. If you were valve, what would you do? You can't satisfy everyone so what tradeoffs would you take?
-
-
Valve is a big corporation, they dont care about doing whats right, just what makes more money.
If i was Valve and am i billion dollar company i would care more for the customer, and doign this thats not always the best financially but makes people happy


Cant answer to your other question, ur spoiling



YouDaMANRAJ ðŸŽ‚ â€” Today at 5:17 AM
Do you ever get worried about random fans showing up to your house because youve shown it before on stream / has that ever happened.
If you played the ti3 game 5 again on todays patch which team do you think has the better draft. Be honest.
-
-
1. yes it has happened once or twice someone has come here, a russki guy with his gf was backpacking in europe and was waiting outside my house for like an hour, i saw them but didnt think any of it
and when i was gonna walk my dogs they were still there, they were nice to be a little weird.
no im not worried. If i was a tiny girl streamer i would be more worried, but am not, and any trespassers will get the bat.
2. Navi for sure id say, wisp ck is not that strong anymore, no counter to enigma, bat is op


Lp_pL â€” Yesterday at 9:46 AM
With the recent Alliance roster disband, will the team be rebuilding from scratch, buying over other teams or taking a break from dota and focusing on other games ?
-
-
I dont make these decisions, or take part in it,  howver im sure just rebuilding from scratch makes the most sense



admiralanjing â€” Yesterday at 9:51 AM
do you think all MCs are retarded ironically or do you actually believe that?
-
-
only some, like you and devon



Seal Gang Aqua Homie â€” Yesterday at 10:38 AM
With all the changes Twitch is making - no 70/30, more ads, elevated chat etc.,  Would you consider maybe testing cross streaming on YouTube as well in the near future? You already have over 250k subscribers there, so might as well try to utilise it.
-
-
as far as i know you cant cross stream, twitch recently had a change where you can stream on other platforms but not at the same time.
If i were able to stream twitch and youtube same time, maybe, but im not gonna stream 2 times onces for twitch and another for twitch



zenlew â€” Yesterday at 11:10 AM
How do you take care of your mental health as a streamer, especially when playing Dota with MCs since our performance very likely makes you malding
-
-
I dont


Laden â€” Yesterday at 2:26 PM
Did you ever think of playing DnD on or off-stream, with virtual tabletops it's really easy to get in nowadays
-
-
Yes but seems kinda time consuming



Maogor the Cruel â€” Yesterday at 3:12 PM
Which team are you rooting for to win the Aegis since Aluliance out from this year TI? do u think ame still have a chance despite he loss once again against team Spirit in the last Major
-
-
None, im not really that invested in dota anymore. no alliance, no team star.



Carti â€” Yesterday at 7:49 PM
Will you bring back Pro Soccer Online around the time the World Cup starts?
-
-
Yea maybe



Ponyboy â€” Yesterday at 8:25 PM
Is visiting hobbiton on your bucket list? Highly recommended
-
-
No, but its a good suggestion, i might do it sometime



zenlew â€” Today at 6:59 AM
Do you have any specific strategy you use to win dota game back then when you are still in Alliance
-
-
Well for me it was always, LD = farm radiance, go fight, win.
NP, avoid teamfights with prophet untill we get our key items and are stronger. go fight, abuse buyback = win



Bromedy â€” Today at 7:16 AM
What type of fan-made games would you enjoy the most playing if we make one? 2D platformer, story-driven RPG, strategy game, etc.?
-
-
I appreciate any games knowing a fan put time into it, i do love platformers the most tho.



devon â€” 10/03/2022
how cucked / affected are u with the new 50:50 twitch cutÂ´
