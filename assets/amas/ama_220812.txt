Sure but the one i had is in for repair so i dont have a cam and am struggling.
If you wanna sponsor one i saw a video on a new one, Insta360 Link.

what was the biggest amount of alcohol you have ever taken in one sitting?

do you know someone who helps you buy the brand new PC tech like Nvidia GPUs on the day they are out?
-
-
No, im pretty sure any serious big company dont give preference to customers as it would make others angry.
When the 3000 series came out, i ordered one but one of the ppl working there said the one i bought alot of others did
and recommended another brand since less bought it = shorter queue.
So in a way i got help, but didnt get ahead of the queue in anyway.



SmokeGank â€” 08/07/2022
can you reduce the playsound cost? one playsound costs 14k while resub gives 10k points and $10 dono gives 10k points. this means we get to use one playsound a month which is absurd
-
-
I think you forget i average 30k viewers at anytime on stream. That means about one thousand playsounds per day.
And you wanna increase that? NOP.
90% of playsounds are people with no sense of comedy and just use them randomly = annoying.
I dont wanna increase playsounds. They only exist because sometimes they are funny.

2 questions onii chan admiralDaki

1. your favourite part of your daily schedule (reddit, dota :emiliaPout: , wordle games, non-dota games, etc....)? :AA_Think: 

2.  your favourite day of your weekly schedule (wedneday with mediashare and point request etc.)? :AA_Think:
-
-
1. Whatever i do after dota is usually the most fun
2. Favorite day is probably wed as you mentions because of literally the things you said.
While i did have other things like sunday fathead feud, saturday immortal day its no longer a thing, for now. Only wed has scheduled things

I want your honest opinion about taunting in video games such as teabagging. Is it deserving of punishments?
-
-
I think its fine, as long as its not overdone. Hopefully pros dont start all chatting more and keep it somewhat classy.
Taunting and BM:ing is an art, you wanna banter, and do a little smack talk, you dont wanna be a bully or toxic.

Stream for fun, see it as a hobby, dont expect to make money, dont expect to become a big streamer, dont expect to become a full time streamer.
Do it because you like it.

As Lacari is one of your best friends, do you think he will keep working out (somewhat regularly at least) after Knut camp is over or is it mostly the hype that keeps him going and he will stop once it's over?
-
-
I think he will quit, as most of they will.



Gubben â€” 08/07/2022
Have you found yourself talking out loud when playing off stream as if you were streaming. Or is it easy for you to "shut off".
-
-
I always talk to my self out loud, whether im playing games or walking dogs, i googled to make sure im not crazy and it seems to be somewhat normal



pyra â€” 08/07/2022
What is your CURRENT favorite hero and build in dota to play and most hated to verse and why? (Favorite is currently while in MC games doing your builds)

OD is the worst, biggest aids hero, too much random burst and make you unable to play for 4 seconds every 12 seconds or so.
Most fun, lina spell build, jugg spell build, lifestealer aghs

there are a bunch of excellently designed RPG maps in wc3 custom games like Daemonic Sword - will you play them outside of hype train reward?

No i dont think so, never heard of it and getting into some random 20 year old RPG doesnt sound like the most fun thing.

Yes after i retired, TSM but decided to stay with alliance and will stay here untill i die :)

Do you ever see yourself moving out of your current house?
What do you plan to do after your successful streaming career or as you get older and Dota slowly dies?

2. Play other games, or just retire, but no plans to stop streaming for the unforseeable future

What is your stance on substance abuse, do you think the current system of banning drugs is effective or should we as a society move to decriminalize them as some countries are doing?
Also if you had to say - is Jizelle self aware and exploiting idiots or is she herself also clueless in regards to her content?
-
-
Dont have any real opinion about first question, sure smaller drugs but i dont ever see stuff like heroine or cocain being legal to buy
Im leaning toward to jizelle being an idiot.

How do you get yourself to workout even on days when u feel like really not going.
Would a woman whos sort of a fitness freak (one with abs and too much muscle) seem like a good marriage partner to you?
-
-
I dont.
And i prefer feminine girls so a musclar one would not be my cup of tea.



Fleshtotem â€” 08/07/2022
Is there any particular thought process or reason you pick up and roll with certain stream content?  A few examples like the furry stuff that started last year, or the roleplaying with lotr/gothmog stuff.  Do you do it for the content, the chat reactions, or just because you find it funny?  I'm genuinely curious if its a conscious choice to incorporate that or just slowly happened over time.  Not a meme question
-
-
All the reason you mentioned, gotta talk about something, and gothmog is pretty cool, ngl

Hello Bulldog,

Do you still keep a schedule for working out these days? What was your weakest excuse to get out of it? (e.g. "I'll do it tomorrow," "I'd rather do your mom," and "walking my dogs is enough exercise.") Has it been better pre/post-pandemic? gain-wise. 

26 days until the release of Ring of Powers :FatChest: , are you still going to watch it? Or has it been "ruined" by :Ackchyually: Tolkien scholars on the internet? Where they screamed the loudest on which part is canon, and by extension set up expectations for people on what the movie should look like. (99% of people don't read the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings)
Me? I'm just excited to see the big baddie Morgoth, what are you most excited to see from Ring of Powers?
-
-
Atm im doing primarly cardio almost everyday, only excuse i use is i dont want ot do it sometimes so i dont :4head:

Ofc im gonna watch rings of power, its not been ruined by me. Although i meme alot about it on stream, and sure its my favorite trilogy/movie but its just a movie. 
I never read the books, i havent rewatched lotr in years, im dont really know much of the lore, or care to.
Its just a tv show coming out, im not that invested in it.
I hope its good, i just hope the wokeism isnt right up in your face.
