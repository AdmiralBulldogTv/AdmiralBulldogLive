3. I fucked your mom

Since u are not only a godgamer in games but also in quizez and struggling. Would you consider going to mizkif schooled Show?
U would get: money to win, gain reach, show to whole twitch how smart are and mizkif knows u so easy to get in.
-
-
I generally dont like doing ''colabs'' because content creators are generally just shitty ppl who dont care about you and just wanna increase their clout to make more money.
Example, that complete garbage austin dating show, 90% do it only to increase their clout.
Or trash talk shows.
HOWEVER the mizkif schooled show is a good idea, seems fun and geniune so if i got invited i might do it.

1. No, when i dont feel like doing it i just skip it, its fun when i have some movie i really wanna watch
2. Both yes and no, it would have been fun to go to TI in sweden, specially if i was invited, doing MC meetup etc assuming covid wasnt a big issue.
But at the same time its the best free content and watching it from home is pretty sweet

Continuing on from last AMA, You said you would be the Emperor of Kappastan, there would be no access to internet without verifying who they are,
 Death penalty to scalpers, No violent prisoners leave prison ever unless deemed rehabilitated and Weebs would be shot on site. 
How is the succession of Kappastan ensured? Would you have a single wife who's child would take over after you,
 multiple wives and you choose or a harem of women who you don't marry and their children need to fight and the winner takes over after you?
-
-
Multiple wife, have many sons, i wouldnt have the stupid monarchy rule where the oldest son would take over
Just like in north korea, the oldest son was deemed to weak to take over, its just too risky to go by the ''oldest son takes over'' rule

If you got a gamba sponsor, would you do it?
-
-
Alliance already has vbet. Im not technically against people having a gambling sponsor but theres some nuance to it.
You need to make sure its a legit site since alot of these sites are shady, you need to know your audiance and how old they are.
Sadly betting sites pay the most and esport teams need money to run their teams
However when you have an audiance thats 13-18 and already being set for life and  dont even really need the money
while promoting a gambling site, gambling on stream for hours with money thats not even yours, is the peak of human greed (xqc)

But to answer the question, if i was offered it i would consider it, if its a legit site, paid well, 99% of my audiance is 18+, id be fine with it.
I'd probably do similar giveaways like raid shadow legends. But theres alot of factors that would have to be considered first.

While gambling is the worst, everything can be bad for you, theres a personal responsibility, thats why its more okay if you have an older audiance compared to a 
younger one because they kids dont understand it.
Khezu has a beer sponsor, thats alcholism, alcholism destroys alot of lifes, should he be shamed for having it? ofc not.
If someone has McDonalds as a sponsor, its unhealthy food that can make alot of people fat and die an early death, should they be shamed? No

Do your SJW megacucks or mods complain when you make politically incorrect jokes?
What do you think of the cancel movement where racist jokes = you're racist, sexist jokes = you're sexist?
-
-
So youre probably a pepeg, heres the same example i used during OG drama.
In WHAT THE DUB
Sexist jokes are fine, if they are well timed, some thought put into it and its an actual good joke.
However if everytime theres a women, everyone would do a joke ''haha woman kitchen, haha woman driving'' Its not funny, in fact its just flat out sexist.

If it was allowed in discord to do edgy jokes, like sexist jokes it would devolve super quickly into a sexist, toxic shit fest because people like are retarded.

No a sexist joke doesnt make you sexist but my guess is you havent fully understood theres some nuance to it.
My IQ is 189 and i know how to make excellent well timed jokes with edgy subjects, most pepegs in discord do not.
