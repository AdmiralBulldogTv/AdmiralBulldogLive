bulldog when are you going to have cats?

Ill never have cats, why have cats over dogs? Dogs are superior in every single way.
Dogs even force you to actually go outside and walk them, which is much needed for a gaymer.



Sepitys ‚Äî Yesterday at 3:00 PM
Based on your answer to my last AMA question, you seem to enjoy organizing social events. With this assumption on mind, have you ever taken a look at being a dungeon/gamemaster for a pen&paper type of game like Dungeons&Dragons or Pathfinder?
-

Well i ddnt organize the event, it was mostly drunkmers and carti. David was babbling about DnD but need a dungeon master? dont really understand how it works

if Alliance fails to deliver good results, what's the chance we see jitizm and you in team?

0, his mindset is too frail and gives up too easy.



Havoc ‚Äî Yesterday at 3:28 PM
last game you laugh at my joke, then tell me to be based but not toxic. How toxic is too toxic and how do you differentiate between toxicity and based?
-
-
You use your brain, from what ive heard youre on the line of getting perma banned, and since you cant tell apart based and toxicity id suggest you stay away from it completly.



wavey_D_D ‚Äî Yesterday at 3:30 PM

Why you inviting in your games same people over and over?

Because they have personalities, and i like them. Theres literally a number system infront of MC names so everyone gets to play. No, im not going to play with everyone equally.

What are your coping tools you use to deal with anxiety and stress?
What is a good song you recently discovered and would recommend?
-
-
I'm not a zoomer, i dont have coping tools, i man up and get through it.
If something causes me stress then i stop doing that thing, i used to get stressed out getting to the train in time, so i just leave 10 minutes earlier = no more stress. 
Its not rocket science.
If something causes me anxiety I.E feeling nervous, then theres no need to deal with it, its a human emotion.

I just started listening to michael jackson again, any of his hit songs are bangers. Zzoomer

i feel depressed what should i do?
-

First let me correct you, you probably feel sad. Feeling sad is normal, if you feel sad, identify whats causes you this and address it. Do things that make you happy.
Taking steps do being more healthy also makes you feel happier, put goals, work towards them.

Squiggle McDeluxe ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:25 PM
Do you actively do things to fix your audio issues or do they randomly get fixed on their own without you having to do anything? (also reminder to add :WutFace: back)
-
-
I have swapped every wire, swapped the mic sm7b, sound mixer, focusrite, pretty much anything that should affect it.
Seeing as changing wires fixed it for a few weeks, only for it to come back for ONE day then fixed itself again makes it impossible to narrow it down what causes it.
I have no idea, probably some electrical issue. Planning to seperate the two PC's away from eachother and using different outlets, for now its fine, if it keeps happening
ill just try a one PC setup and see if that fixes it.

Would you date a zoomer girl
Why so much obesity and how to fix
-
-
If you find someone you like who happens to be 21 and uses zoomer slang that wouldnt really be a deal breaker, as just like any language you would just learn to understand it.

Obesity is caused by bad habits and lack of knowledge about food. Body positivity movement doesnt help, telling fat ppl they are fine the way the are.
Theres nothing wrong with being fat, but you should always looks to improve.

Fixing it is about breaking bad habits, and replacing with good ones. Not going on any diets. No food makes you fat, you dont need to put your body in ''fat burning mode''
by eating once a day or cutting carbs.
Its all about finding foods you enjoy, that makes you feel full for around 2000 cal a day, depending on sex, height, weight, activity level, etc.
