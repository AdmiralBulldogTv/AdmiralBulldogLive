Well it was just experimental, and longer streams are better for stream performance but i might go back
to it someday


Sqiguel McDeluxe â€” Yesterday at 11:53 AM
Are there going to be (at least 1) more voice lines in the alliance supporters club? Some teams have 3 lines while we only have 2 :TriSad:

Streaming took longer, my dad still asks about how it works because hes a pepeg.

Dedavond â€” Yesterday at 12:17 PM
Have you ever thought about doing one of those ancestry or health DNA tests? Or don't want a company to have your Godgamer DNA to clone you?
-
-
Not really but i might do it, they are kinda expensive so will struggle to afford it sadly.

Large Farva â€” Yesterday at 12:19 PM
Do you sometimes miss the competitive aspect of pro dota?

Yes i miss the part of playing in tournaments, but i dont miss playing 12 hours every day
or playing scrims, or having to travel all the time and rarely being home.

Do you miss the old versions of some emotes that are no longer popular anymore, like plain old Pepega?
-
-
No, i think the emote game is stronger than ever.


Confucius Zenlew â€” Yesterday at 12:24 PM
what's the approximate age-range you think you're going to stop streaming and in your opinion what would be the possible reason that makes you stop
-
-
Theres no age range, being 60 years old wouldnt change anything. The things that would make me stop streaming is
1. Is it still fun or a chore now?
2. If its not fun anymore, do i need the money? Depends, is my wife very expensive?


Void â€” Yesterday at 12:25 PM
If other platforms reached out to you and gave you a contract you can't easily reject, would you take it?
-
-
I would be VERY unlikely to change away from twitch


Confucius Zenlew â€” 12/18/2021
Tell us the ups and downs as a streamer, what kind of challenges or struggles you faced as full time streamer and how can we help(Besides donating) ðŸ™‚
-
-
All streamers worry about their future, viewer count, how much money they make, forcing themselves to stream more than they should etc.
It can get pretty bad for some, luckily im in a position where i dont need to worry too much about my future anymore.

So i just stream whatever i want, whenever i want. This way i dont have to have the dreaded days of ''oh no gotta play 6 hours of dota today''
Only thing that gets to me once in a while is chat, but just cracking down on behaviour i dont like, like complaining about stuff which is currently
being fixed.


Mao â€” 12/18/2021
Twitch recap, top 3 watched channel?
-
-
Didnt get a recap, i dont really watch streams for more than 5 minutes anyway. I usually hang out with my gfs.

Thoughts on the Witcher season 2?
-
-
Didnt watch season 1 so no thoughts.
I didnt play the game, i watched 2-3 episodes of season 1, think i was done when they showed the elf king was captured or something
Made me think of LOTR and how low budget and scuffed witcher looked.

Alex :) â€” 12/18/2021
did u have some variety game that u wouldve played more per day but u felt u have to finish your dota duties for the frogs first?
is there a sequel u wish was made from some game u played when u were younger?
-
-
Cant think of any variety game no.
I hecking loved dungeon keeper 1 and 2. 
Believe 3 was teased and to be played as the other side so was pretty hype but was cancelled or never happened


Diddily â€” 12/18/2021
how did you get into video games or dota growing up?
-
-
Grew up with snes and nintendo 64.
Go a computer pretty early, played tons of heroes of might and magic 1, and eventually the third. Tons of other games aswell.
Went to a lan with a friend where ppl played dota and thats how i got into it


Cabito â€” 12/18/2021

-
Probably not


Goobie â€” 12/18/2021
God of War is being released on PC in January next year, are you going to play/stream it, BOY?
-
-
Yes


Inberbe_ â€” 12/18/2021
If pewdiepie asks to do a dota collab stream with you would you go with it?
-
-
Not really a fan of doing collab with ppl i dont know. Not really a fan of ''influencers'' and ''internet celebrities'' they are so thirsty to grow.

It brings me back to the amogus era.
Being invited to play with ''influencers'' or i could play with MCs

I didnt join because i was shy, but because that i dont wanna play with a group of people i dont know
whos just there for clout.

Rather play with ppl i know and like.

However since its pewdiepie id make an exception


Charasific â€” 12/18/2021
How likely do you think it is for you to actually end up subbed into an alliance games, will you be with them at LANs?

Probably very unlikely

I honestly dont have a favorite music genre. Like most music, specially 80s. but theres good music from all eras, today aswell


[A]Drunkmers â€” 12/18/2021
How do zoomers/pro players manage to play 12-14 pubs a day without losing their shit? How many pubs did you use to play when you were on the grind?
-
-
Because you have a passion and an urge to be the best and prove urself.
I dont think i ever was one of these ILTW kids who play 14 pubs every day. 
Was more just paly all day. have some breaks, play another game, play some scrims etc


Jitizm the Jewish â€” 12/18/2021
Do you think Drunkmers will ever reach Divine?
-

Yes but never immortal


Mao â€” 12/18/2021
Do you think Drunkmers will be allowed to lives in sweden ?

iAttorney â€” 12/18/2021
What is your honest opinion of the new roster? Do you think they can achieve more than the previous roster?
-
-
Initially i was pretty positive to it. Still like the players and still see potential but the results atm not looking too hot, no denying that
Hopefully it doesnt get to the lads too much and they can come back from it because theres potential


SergeantX â€” 12/18/2021
From your personal experiences, how can you differentiate/detect fake people?
-
-
haha its hard to say, i guess people who appears to play a role, who try too hard to appease others.
Mostly its just gut feeling i guess.


eXeQtOr â€” 12/18/2021

Dunno, never done in ds3, will beat the game first and see


Sepitys â€” 12/18/2021
Warhammer 3 releasing more information about the new factions and their unit rosters, etc, 
has some factions peaked your interest since the last time you were asked about your thoughts towards Warhammer 3?
-
-
I dont care at all about the warhammer part, to me its total war: fantasy. and in that sense tw 1 and 2 pretty much mostly covers all factions
Some of the new factions seems kinda nice, like ogres
For warhammer frogs the idea of a faction like Khrone might be hecking amazing to me its just a demon/chaos faction that already exists.

Still fun with new factions, im primarly just hoping for improvements to the core features, like animation, performance, siege battles, AI etc.


Papaya â€” 12/18/2021
When I'm back in Sweden wanna do a cooking stream together?

I dont cook, i eat.


PonyBoy â€” 12/18/2021
Would you consider making AMA monthly again?
-
-
Maybe in a while, but the questions were closer to twitch chat messages. and tons of repeats


SmokeGank â€” 12/18/2021
what do you think is the current problem in alliance games? is it the drafting, playing with new members or something else? 
they play well early on but make tiny mistakes throughout the game which compound into lost team fights and games
-
-
Feels like they miss a clear leader and someoen who takes control on what to do. They also dont seem to gel immedietly so hoping this will be fixed 
after break.
But i believe :)
