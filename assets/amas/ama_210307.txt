Do you take long shower after you play some sponsored trash games in order to forgot how cheap you are actually?
-
I'm not sure if you are serious about this questions but ill give you a simple serious answer.

I would hope most normal viewers respond to seeing a streamer playing a sponsored game would be is ''oh nice mr streamer making some ez money good for him''
But then theres salty entitled ppl.
Usually this question comes from a place of jealousy, knowing that someone gets paid alot of money to play a game frustrates people.

The transaction is simple, game developer makes a game and wants to advertise it, some do it by paying a streamer. 
When i personally do it i usually go over the top with praising the game which i think to any normal person comes across as sarcastic and memey.

I dont see anything cheap or dirty about it, i play variety at the end of the stream anyway.
