:Ackchyually: before they charged out of helmâ€™s deep. 
Aaragon asked to barricade the entrance to the caves while also asking the women and children  to evacuate, thatâ€™s why they probably deleted that scene in the caves.
-
-
I just rewatched it and you were right in that he said so however i still think youre wrong.
When they charge out there is hunreds of orcs rushing into the halls/caves.
How do you barricade within 5 minutes when there was no established plan for it?
assuming there is a door to the caves, they have battering rams. and the door to the caves should be way less fortified than the one to the halls.
If there is no door, throwing some stuff infront the entrance wont work.
They also said there was a passage to the mountain, but they are being run down by massive, fast, fit orcs. they will outrun 95% of the people in the caves.

I would say they didnt keep the scene where eowyn fights the uruk hais in the cave because it makes no sense when to cut to it.

Theoden charges out, epic scene, its a doomed charge, gandalf shows up, wins the fight. At no point during this sequence would it make sense
to cut to eowyn fighting in the caves. Not after either.

What's your opinion on gambling and past gambling meta. Could gambling possibly be fun for you.
And... Would you do a gambling stream if for example someone donated you $1000 to gamble on any site of your choice or if casino actually sponsored gambling stream.
-
-
Gambling is fun, if done responsibly. I've had stronger opinions in the past but i honestly dont care too much about the topic.
If someone donate 1000 for me to gamble, then no. 
If a casino sponsor me, still probably no. Money changes people, its hard to say, depends how much.
I have no plans and rather just do cool video game sponsors or nordvpn

Ultimately it comes down to, increasing bank account number (while already being very well off) knowing you will ruin some of your viewers life, its hard to justify.
One way to do it is to tell yourself ''personal accountability'' 
They are responsible for their own action, but you are ''introducing'' them, and gambling is an addication. people literally cant help themselves.

If you are gonna do a gambling stream, own up to it, dont say ''dont gamble'' while you are sponsored gambling on stream to help you sleep better at night, its pathetic.

So i would never say never, i mean alliance is sponsored by it, while that is a bit different as they need to do it to survive and its not in your face, i dont need it to survive.

Batman begins 9/10, dark night 10/10 dark knight rises 10/10. Yes i enjoy it more, but while saying that i still love the second one and the joker. Bane is more inetresting and the movie is better IMO.

Because its an among us clone.

Among us came out, lots of fun
Gets boring after a while
Tons of clones come out
Try them a little
Goose is a decent clone with some unique changes
Gets boring after a while
Months pass, hey lets play among us for a little agian
Why not goose? because its a fucking clone, why not play the original. Also getting into among us is omega easy and everyone knows it. Goose has 300 roles and half the chat wont unedrstand whats happening.

Goose was a fun among us clone for a bit, its dead

0 interest, i could only see its use if you travel, i dont for the moment so it makes no sense to me. If im at home why would i ever use it.
IF i were travelling alot, would i get one, probablyh still no. I would just use a laptop to play if i wanted.
And if i dont want the hassle of pulling out the PC every time or limited space, i would just play/watch something on my phone.
