PonyBoy — Today at 1:32 PM
What do you think is the main problem for the inconsistent performance by alliance?
-
-
Inconsistent performance? They really have had 1-2 times they did decently for a week.
Nothing inconsistent about their performance, they play subpar for the last few months, so the TI result isnt that suprising
They need to play better or they wont win.


OwenNewo — Today at 1:34 PM
