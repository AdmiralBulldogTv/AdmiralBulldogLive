Would you ever visit the US? If so, where would you go and what would you do?

-

-

I have been to US many times for TI, and one tournament in new york and vegas.

I still would like to go there for vacationing for sure, texas, new york and california.

Eat fatty Food and sight seeing.







Trueblue â€” 02/05/2022

Have you ever thought about becoming a variety streamer?

-

-

By my definition i am a variety streamer. Before my stream was 90% dota.

Now i maybe like 1 or 2 games per day, if even that, in a 7 hour stream.



If you mean something like singsing then no. I rarely fall in love with games and get bored easily.

To fill a stream with playing random games would not be fun for me.







Spacedandy15 â€” 02/05/2022

how much money have you spent on your streaming PC ?

-

-

Maybe 5k usd, its mainly cpu that cost like half. If you are considering streaming and doing 2pc setup, dont.

Its expensive, and a hassle. More complicated setup = more problems. When problems arise = way harder to solve

because complicated setup and not googlable solution.

The primary reason for having 2 PC setup is mildy better stream quality which at this point is neglible compared to before.

1pc setup is way more effiencent compared to 5 years ago, better quality and less performance impact.



I mainly keep 2 PC setup because im an fps whore, and streaming and playing on same PC hurts performance (not as much as it used to)

Once dota 2 is dead, will you switch to league

Suiggle McProSPAM â€” 02/05/2022

CartiTarti à¶ž â€” 02/05/2022

GladiatorZ3D- â€” 02/05/2022

i have 2 questions 

1: do you like windows 11 ? 

2: do you approve forsen as a semi god gamer ?  (ofc you are only and real god gamer in planet )

-

-

1. I thought about changing one PC to Windows 11 but havent, so cant comment. From what i heard it doesnt sound fully complete

and missing features so not jumping on that train for a while, specially not gaming/stream pc.

2. No, hes a good gamer.







icyraud â€” 02/05/2022

Any chance of streaming outside once covid is over?

-

-

No, im not really an IRL streamer, only reason it would happen is if one the GF:s is very outgoing and is into it.







BuayaDaratBuset â€” 02/05/2022

on alliance rewind video, it said alliance planning on doing a world tour. if its happening, are you gonna yoining the world tour? 

-

-

PepeLaugh







Diddily â€” 02/05/2022

would you ever consider becoming more involved in the coaching of Alliance? do you ever get asked for input on a potential roster signing or strategy for the team?

-

-

No coaching, when it comes to competing and trying to be the best in the world you dont want someone half assing it.

Am i gonna abandond streaming to become a full time coach? No.

And Kelly does tell me the roster changes but its the players who decides most.







Arken â€” 02/05/2022

how do you usually spend your day after ending the stream?

20 despair abit

21 walk dogs

Kapitan - Mirana Enjoyer â€” 02/05/2022

Are you considering to buy ps5? I like watching your gow playthrough, or do i have to wait for another 5 years so you could play it? :DESPAIR~1:

-

-

I will not stream console, primarly because its a nightmare setting it up with 2 pc and also i hate playing using controllers.







SikZone â€” 02/05/2022

on the topic above if the community was to crowdfund a ps5, would you consider playing GoW Ragnarok or other ps5 exclusives?

-

-

No, see reason above.







EliteFwiz â€” 02/05/2022

do you enjoy collaborating with other streamers like when you played pubg with forsen and dota with the juicer? would you like to do it more?

-

-

No, alot of ''influencers'' do collabs, with the primary purpose of reaching another audience and growing their brand and in turn

the amount of money they make.

I dont care about growing, or making more money.

1. the ''collab'' with XQC only happened because there was a fall guys tournament and i wanted to paly, i saw XQC tweeted somethign about a spot

I wrote only because i wanted to play, not because i wanted to collab or whatever.

Playing with forsen only happened because my then gf knew forsen gf and i believe they set it up.



Im not against collab with other creators if its someone i like.







Spacedandy15 â€” 02/05/2022

if gawr gura or any hololive en member asked you to collab,would you do it ? 

-

-

See above and you have the answer







future exmod,never vip,ok viewer â€” 02/05/2022

Do you think AAA games in general have been getting worse? If yes, why? If no, what do you think cause the bad/poor perception of these games? (ie people being whiny, etc)

-

-

Dont really have any strong opinion for this, i dont really feel they have gotten worse.

Maybe people feel they have because new games mostly just redo same shit and has lots of bugs.

How did you meet ales?

What was the most expensive PC part you bought and how much was it?

-

-

I havent met her, i think she was suggested by henry to become a mod since she was really active, and since then she has just been really helpful

and either streaming CPU or 3090, im kinda a PC enthusiast. Luckily i managed to get a 3090 on release with no queue at like 2k (swedish prices are expensive)

now they cost like 3k in stores in sweden.
